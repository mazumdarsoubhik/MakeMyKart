# MakeMyKart

Project Title: "MakeMyKart - Your Personalized Food Preference Explorer and Ingredient Shopping Companion"

Problem Statement:
Many individuals face difficulties in creating an organized shopping list for their household groceries, often resulting in forgetting essential items during their shopping trips.

Solution Idea:
MakeMyKart is an AI-powered app designed to address this problem by providing users with personalized dish recommendations based on their preferences and helping them create a comprehensive shopping list.

Planned Features:
1. Personalized Dish Recommendations: Users can input their food preferences, dietary restrictions, and cuisine preferences. MakeMyKart will utilize AI algorithms to suggest a wide range of dishes tailored to their preferences.

2. Dish Selection and Shopping List Generation: Once users select the dishes they want to prepare, MakeMyKart will automatically generate a detailed shopping list, including all the necessary ingredients.

3. Ingredient Management: Users can manage their pantry inventory within the app, allowing them to keep track of the ingredients they already have and avoid unnecessary purchases.


Technical Architecture:
MakeMyKart utilizes large language model to process user inputs, generate dish recommendations, and create shopping lists. The backend of the app is built using Flask framework, while the frontend employs web rendering and UI design with the help of Bootstrap.

What's Out of Scope:
1. Placing Orders: MakeMyKart does not have the capability to directly place orders, as it does not integrate with supermarket inventories or payment gateways.
2. Cooking Instructions: The app focuses on generating personalized dish recommendations and shopping lists. It does not provide step-by-step cooking instructions.

MakeMyKart aims to simplify the process of grocery shopping by providing personalized dish recommendations and assisting users in creating well-organized shopping lists. By leveraging AI technologies, the app helps users make informed choices, save time, and enhance their overall cooking and shopping experiences.
